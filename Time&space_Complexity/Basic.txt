Q. What is Time Complexity ?
A. Amount of time taken by algo. to run as a function
of length of input.

Q. What is Space Complexity ?
A. Amount of space taken by algo. to run as a function
of length of input.

Unit to represent Time Complexity --> 

1. Big O(Upper Bound)--> Worst time taken by algo.
2. Theta(Avg. Case) --> Avg. time taken by algo.
3. Omega(Lower Bound)--> Min. time taken by algo.

Big O Complexity --> 

1. Constant time --> O(1)
2. logarithmic time --> O(logn)
3. Linear time --> O(n)
4. Quadratic time --> O(n^2)
5. Cubic time --> O(n^3)

Time Complexity order --> 

O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(n^3) <
O(2^n) < O(n!) < O(n^n)
